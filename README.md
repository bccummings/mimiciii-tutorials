# mimiciii-tutorials
Tutorials in R, Rmd, and the (MIMIC-III)[https://mimic.physionet.org/] dataset for the University of Michigan SOCR and MDP programs. For more tutorials, please visit the excellent MIT Laboratory of Computational Physiology [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code).

## Purpose

The tutorials contained in this repository are designed for students in the Multidisciplinary Design Program ([MDP](https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/)) from the University of Michigan College of Engineering, and studying under the Statistics Online Computational Resource ([SOCR](http://www.socr.umich.edu/)). 

The tutorials are separated into parts, usually intended to showcase one aspect of the R programming language or the MIMIC-III dataset.

## Part 1 - Data Extraction with SIRS

The purpose of this portion is to showcase a possible method of extracting data from the MIMIC-III database. It extracts parameters relating to the Systemic Inflamatory Response Syndrome ([SIRS](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2492881)) as it relates to sepsis. The end result of this tutorial is a CSV containing sample data for several thousand patients. This data will be provided to MDP students after they have completed the data use agreement required by MIT-LCP.

## Part 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization with SIRS

Part 2 is a continuation of the first section, where the sample data is investigated. More information to follow as the tutorial is updated.
